                  <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The <span class="tabs">"Truss Estimator"</span> uses the parameters set in
                      <span class="tabs">"Cost Variables"</span> and the design preferences set in
                      <span class="tabs">"Job Defaults"</span> to produce accurate roof truss quotes
                      with ease and speed.
                    </p><br>
                  <h3>Section 1, 2, etc.</h3>
                    <p>When quoting, a plan can be broken down into multiple sections.  Tackle large plans a
                      section at a time.  When a section is completed, click the <span class="ref">"+"</span>
                      button in the top right corner of the <span class="ref">"Section 1"</span> section,
                      and a duplicate <span class="ref">"Section 2"</span> will appear below.  You must
                      have a span and run entered before you can add another Section.
                    </p><br>
                  <h3>Top Row Inputs</h3>
                    <p>The five top row inputs of the  <span class="tabs">"Truss Estimator"</span>
                      are required.  There are two options for the entering method, Span and Run,
                      which is the default method, or Area Input.
                    </p><br>
                  <h3>Default Input Method</h3>
                    <p>Divide the plan you are quoting into rectangular sections with a specific
                      span and truss run.  Each section will start and end with a truss.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Span:</b> Enter the truss span or width for the specific section.  If the ends are
                        cantilievered, include this in the span.
                      </li>
                      <li><b>Truss Run:</b> Enter the truss run or length of the section.
                      </li>
                      <li><b>Slope:</b> Enter the nearest slope to match the plan being quoted.
                        If you have an unequal sloped hip roof, select the slope of the full span hip trusses.
                      </li>
                      <li><b>Truss Spacing:</b> Select the desired truss spacing from the dropdown.

                    <h3>Area Input Method</h3>
                      <p>When a section cannot be easily squared off into a span and run input (example:
                        angled walls or slight jogs), you can toggle Area Input.  Top row inputs change
                        to Area and Span.  Take the average span of the section for the Span input if
                        all spans are not the same.  Each section will start and end with a truss.
                      </p>

                        <li><b>Span:</b> Enter the truss span in decimal feet for the specific section.
                          If you are covering an area with multiple spans, enter the most common or average span.
                          Currently, the maximum clear span is 40 feet.  You may enter longer spans, but
                          intermediate bearings will be assumed.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Slope:</b> Enter the nearest slope to match the plan being quoted.

                      <li><b>End 1, End 2:</b> When top row inputs are entered, pricing will reflect common
                        trusses including a truss at each end.  The dropdown selections here allow you to make
                        appropriate adjustments for each end.  If any of these conditions apply, it is recommended
                        that you select from these dropdowns before using any of the functions below.  You can select
                        either <span class="dropdown">"Gable", "Hip", "Valley", "Girder" </span> or
                        <span class="dropdown">"Valley + Girder"</span>.  When <span class="dropdown">"Hip"</span>
                        is selected on on either end, a dropdown box will appear below (End Slope 1 or End Slope 2).
                        Enter the end slope of the hip end.  When <span class="dropdown">"Valley"</span> is selected
                        on either end, a dropdown box will appear below (End Slope 1 or End Slope 2).  Enter the

                        for the specific section.
                      <h4>Default Method</h4>
                        If the Default Method is being used for the section (Span and Run inputs), modifications
                        are applied by selecting the modifier and entering the truss run of the specific modifier.
                        Select the modifier that most closely matches the plan specifications. Take the truss run
                        for the trusses affected in the specific area.  For example, if you have a 28 x 40 building
                        and half of them are scissor trusses, select the Scissor modifier and enter 20 for the run
                        of trusses that will become scissor trusses. Multiple inputs can be made by making a new
                        selection from the <span class="ref">"Modify"</span> dropdown and clicking the
                        <span class="ref">"+"</span> button to apply it.  Once applied, your modification will

                            As spans increase, a deeper depth will be assumed.  Decreased spacing may help to
                            reduce depth slightly, but typically a truss depth slightly greater than one inch
                            per foot of truss span should be expected. Larger spans and slopes over 7/12 may
                            return a price of $0.  Watch the Total section to ensure that the Applied Factor
                            has been applied to the total.  Finally, enter the truss run affected by this

                      If the Area Input method is being used for the section, modifications are applied as
                      a percentage of the area square footage of the specific section.  Select the modifier
                      that most closely matches the plan specifications. Take the percentage of the area
                      for the trusses affected in the specific area.  For example, if you have 1000 square
                      feet entered in the <span class="ref">"Area"</span> input in the top row, and
                      500 square feet is covered by Scissor Trusses, select the modifier and enter

                          As spans increase, a deeper depth will be assumed.  Decreased spacing may help to
                          reduce depth slightly, but typically a truss depth slightly greater than one inch
                          per foot of truss span should be expected. Larger spans and slopes over 7/12 may
                          return a price of $0.  Watch the Total section to ensure that the Applied Factor
                          has been applied to the total.  Finally, select the % of truss area affected by this

                  <h1>Cost Variables</h1><br>
                  <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This tab is of top importance for setting up SUM+IT. Labour variables, Lumber costs, plate
                      costs and Markup preferences are all set in <span class="tabs">"Cost Variables"</span>.
                      Once set up properly, this area will be used only to update changes to material costs.
                    </p><br>
                  <h3>Labour Variables</h3>
                    <p>SUM+IT is constantly improving and adding to the Labour Variables. This is the most
                      difficult part of the process and in most cases, setting up your labour variables will
                      require assistance from a SUM+IT technical advisor.
                    </p><br>
                  <h3>Markup Method</h3>
                    <p>If you apply either Margin or Markup, you can toggle it here.  A third alternative is
                      available to tie profits to plant time. Factor of labor will add a multiple of the labor
                      total as the markup.
                    </p><br>
                  <h3>Material Cost</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Lumber Cost:</b> SUM+IT has provisions for one grade of 2x3 and two grades of 2x4,
                        2x6 and 2x8. You may have a larger lumber inventory. Take your current costs and fit them
                        into these categories the best you can. If you only have one grade of a certain depth, be
                        sure to match up both grades of that lumber depth with the same number.
                      </li>
                      <li><b>2x4 Webs:</b> If you do not have 2x3 in your inventory but begin your webs at 2x4 or
                        greater, check the <span class="ref">"2x4 Webs"</span> box. You'll notice the 2x3 cost
                        input will gray out but it will contain a value. This will correct the app to ensure that
                        2x4 will be priced in place of 2x3.
                      </li>
                      <li><b>Plate Cost:</b> Enter your cost for 20 gauge, 18 gauge and 16 gauge plates.
                        If you do not carry all three gauges of plates, do not leave a field blank. Instead,
                        assign a value similar to the gauges that you carry.
                      </li>
                    </ul><br>
                  <h3>Overhead</h3>
                    <p>If you use Overhead as a part of your pricing method, enter it here.

                  <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>In this tab, various products that you sell can be stored in the app for use in the
                      <span class="tabs">"Floor Estimator"</span> and in the

                      </li> buttons at the top right of each category. Once selected, you can assign a Product Code,
                      product Description, cost, markup and delivery amount for the item. Beam, Joist
                      and Miscellaneous Items should have a price per foot for proper function in the
                      <span class="tabs">"Floor Estimator"</span>. When information is completed, select
                      "Confirm" in the far left column. To undo the entry, click "Cancel." Once confirmed
                      and added, items can be edited with the "Edit" button. When changes are complete,
                      click "Confirm."
                      <li><b>Item Categories:</b> Product Codes are divided into categories for proper
                        function in <span class="tabs">"Floor Estimator"</span>. Enter products under the
                        appropriate headings. The "Additional Items" category is not used in the
                        <span class="tabs">"Floor Estimator"</span>, but items there can be added to
                        quotes when items are compiled in the <span class="tabs">"Print Quote"</span> tab.
